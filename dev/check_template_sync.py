"""Fail when the Word template on Google Drive is not the one in this repo.

WHY THIS EXISTS
---------------
`spec.yaml` pins `template_path` to a Google Drive URL, so a workflow run
fetches the template from Drive -- NOT from `resources/templates/`. The repo
copy is only the editable source and what the test cases point at. Nothing
keeps the two in step.

On 9 Nov 2026 that gap produced a report that looked finished and was not.
`dev/build_report_template.py` had been extended with a tree-crop table, the
retaliation-evidence tables, an incident timeline and a data-completeness
section; the repo .docx was rebuilt and had all 22 tables; the Drive copy was
still the previous build with 18. The run used Drive. The dashboard showed 36
widgets, the report stopped at section 11, and nothing anywhere errored --
`create_docx` renders whatever tags the template happens to contain and
silently drops the context it was handed for tags that are absent.

Every check in `lint_spec.py` and `check_sql_strict.py` passed throughout.
They are offline by design and read the spec, so neither can see Drive.

WHAT IT CHECKS
--------------
That the bytes Drive serves for the pinned URL are byte-identical to
`resources/templates/naibunga_lower_hwc_template.docx`.

Credentials are deliberately omitted, which is the state the workflow runner
is in -- so this also re-verifies the `anyoneWithLink` share setting and that
Drive still holds a real .docx blob rather than a converted Google Doc, the
two other ways the pin fails.

    python3 dev/check_template_sync.py

Exit 0 identical, 1 drifted or unreachable. Needs network; it is the one dev
check here that does, so it is not wired into the offline pre-compile pair.
Run it before a release and after any template rebuild.
